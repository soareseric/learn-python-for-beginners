# Learn Python for Data Analysis for Beginners to Advanced.

## Motivation

I am building this repository for study purposes. I am on the journey to become a Data Analyst, and I want to share what I have learned along the way.

## Prerequisites
1. Python 3.x 
2. Git is installed and you know basics of [git commands.](git/git-basic-commands.md)
3. Have access to terminal/command line.

## List of Content

The content of this repository is organized by levels. First, we start with basic programming concepts using Python. Next, we delve into the world of data analysis and its theories. Finally, we bring everything together and start exploring Python for data analysis. For each section, we will complete at least one project.

Note 1: All of this content is written in the form of "notes" by me. I encourage you to take some time and read the official documentation for the Python language and its libraries. I will always provide these references and others at the end of each topic.

Note 2: At the time of viewing this, I may still be in the process of developing the content and updating this repository. As a result, you may encounter some unclickable topics. The updates to these topics do not follow a specific order and are based on my needs and study progress. Follow me to stay updated on new upgrades.

### Libraries

Note: The purpose of this section is not to cover all Python libraries - this is not even possible. The main goal of this repository section is to delve deeper into libraries that I may be using during my studies and popular ones that I may use in the future.

1. [Pandas](libraries/pandas.md)

Pandas is an open source library, providing high-performance, easy-to-use high level data structures and many data analysis tools for the Python programming language.

2. Matplotlib

Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. Matplotlib makes easy things easy and hard things possible.

3. NumPy

NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. Brings the computational power of languages like C and Fortran to Python. Forms the basis of powerful machine learning libraries Lies at the core of a rich ecosystem of data science libraries. NumPyâ€™s accelerated processing of large arrays allows researchers to visualize datasets far larger than native Python could handle. NumPy's API is the starting point when libraries are written to exploit innovative hardware, create specialized array types, or add capabilities beyond what NumPy provides. 

4. Seaborn

Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

5. Scikit-Learn

Simple and efficient tools for predictive data analysis. Accessible to everybody, and reusable in various contexts. Built on NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib. 

6. TensorFlow

TensorFlow is an open source software library for high performance numerical computation. Its flexible architecture allows easy deployment of computation across a variety of platforms (CPUs, GPUs, TPUs), and from desktops to clusters of servers to mobile and edge devices. TensorFlow is an open-source and popular deep learning library developed by Google.

Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning, a set of algorithms, and is inspired by the structure and function of the human brain.

7. BeautifulSoup

Beautiful Soup is a library that makes it easy to scrape information from web pages. It sits atop an HTML or XML parser, providing Pythonic idioms for iterating, searching, and modifying the parse tree.

8. Selenium

For testers across the world, Selenium is the first choice for executing automated tests. Selenium is an open source automation testing tool that supports a number of scripting languages like Python, C#, Java, Perl, Ruby, JavaScript, etc. depending on the application to be tested, one can choose the script accordingly

9. StatsModels

Statsmodels is a Python module that provides classes and functions for the estimation of many different statistical models, as well as for conducting statistical tests, and statistical data exploration. An extensive list of result statistics are available for each estimator. The results are tested against existing statistical packages to ensure that they are correct.

10. SciPy

SciPy is a free and open-source Python library used for scientific computing and technical computing. It is a collection of mathematical algorithms and convenience functions built on the NumPy extension of Python

11. PyTorch

An open source machine learning framework that accelerates the path from research prototyping to production deployment.

12. Keras

Keras is an API designed for human beings, not machines. Keras follows best practices for reducing cognitive load: it offers consistent & simple APIs, it minimizes the number of user actions required for common use cases, and it provides clear & actionable error messages. It also has extensive documentation and developer guides.
